Whether you're doing bug bounties, internal red teaming, or client-based assessments — **penetration testing is more than just running tools.** Mistakes can lead to missed vulnerabilities, broken systems, or even legal trouble.

Here are the **top 10 mistakes** I've seen beginners (and even intermediates) make — and how to avoid them.

## 🚫 1. Skipping Reconnaissance

Jumping into scanning before proper recon is like trying to break into a house blindfolded. OSINT can reveal subdomains, public breaches, tech stacks, and more.

> 🔍 **Fix:** Use tools like `theHarvester`, `Amass`, and `Shodan` to map your target before touching a scanner.

## ✍️ 2. No Note-Taking

You’ll forget 90% of what you did if you don’t document it. Whether you're writing a report or backtracking an attack chain — notes are your best friend.

> 🛠 **Fix:** Use `CherryTree`, `Obsidian`, or even markdown files with screenshots.

## 🔦 3. Ignoring Scope and Rules of Engagement

Testing outside of scope can get you banned, blacklisted, or worse — legally liable.

> 📋 **Fix:** Always read the scope. If in doubt, ask the client or check the bug bounty policy.

## 🧨 4. Over-Exploitation

Exploiting without caution can crash services and alert blue teams.

> ⚠️ **Fix:** Confirm the impact with minimal proof-of-concept payloads. Never blindly use Metasploit modules.

## 🛠 5. Relying Only on Tools

No tool can replace critical thinking. Automated scanners miss logic bugs, chained vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations.

> 🧠 **Fix:** Understand what each tool does. Pair automation with manual validation.

## 🧼 6. Forgetting Cleanup

Leaving shells, test accounts, or payloads is unprofessional and risky.

> 🧽 **Fix:** Track every change you make. Clean up everything or report what couldn’t be reverted.

## 🔁 7. Not Validating Findings

False positives make your report unreliable.

> ✅ **Fix:** Manually validate every finding. Explain reproduction steps clearly.

## 🧱 8. Weak Reporting

A great pentest is useless without a strong report. If your report lacks clarity, impact, or remediation advice — it’s just noise.

> 📑 **Fix:** Use clear formatting, include impact, screenshots, reproduction steps, and actionable fixes.

## ⚙️ 9. Repeating Attack Paths

If your only trick is SQL injection or password spraying, you’re limiting your growth.

> 🔄 **Fix:** Continuously learn. Explore cloud attacks, AD abuse, SSRF chaining, etc.

## 🧭 10. No Post-Engagement Reflection

You finish the test and move on — without asking, “What did I learn?”

> 🧠 **Fix:** Reflect on your approach, tool usage, and what went well vs what didn’t.
