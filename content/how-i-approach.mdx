Penetration testing is more than just exploiting systems — it's about **thinking like an attacker while acting like a professional**. In this post, I’ll share my personal methodology for approaching real-world penetration tests, the tools I use, and the mindset that guides my ethical decisions.

## 🧭 The Penetration Testing Lifecycle

Understanding the **phases of a penetration test** is crucial. I typically follow a structure similar to the PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard):

| Phase            | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| Reconnaissance   | Gathering OSINT and target data. |
| Scanning         | Identifying live hosts, open ports, services. |
| Enumeration      | Extracting more detailed information about systems. |
| Exploitation     | Gaining unauthorized access. |
| Post-Exploitation| Privilege escalation, lateral movement. |
| Reporting        | Documenting findings, impacts, and mitigations. |

> 💡 **Tip**: Never skip proper documentation. It’s your strongest deliverable.

## 🛠️ My Favorite Tools by Phase

Here’s a list of tools I use in each phase:

| Phase            | Tools Used |
|------------------|------------|
| Reconnaissance   | `theHarvester`, `Shodan`, `Amass`, `SpiderFoot` |
| Scanning         | `Nmap`, `Masscan`, `RustScan` |
| Enumeration      | `Nmap NSE`, `Enum4linux`, `LDAPSearch`, `Nikto` |
| Exploitation     | `Metasploit`, `SQLMap`, `Burp Suite`, `Impacket` |
| Post-Exploitation| `Mimikatz`, `BloodHound`, `Empire`, `CrackMapExec` |
| Reporting        | `CherryTree`, `Dradis`, `Markdown` with screenshots |

## 🧠 The Mindset: Think Like an Attacker, Report Like an Analyst

Successful penetration testers:
- **Follow scope religiously** — never test beyond authorized assets.
- **Take detailed notes** — logs, screenshots, and timestamps matter.
- **Communicate risks, not just vulnerabilities** — how could a real attacker leverage what you found?

> 📌 Ethical integrity is non-negotiable. A good pentest doesn’t harm — it hardens.

## 📝 Real-World Case: Bypassing Authentication to Access Admin Panel

Let’s take a simple, relatable example — you’re on an internal engagement, and you find a web app running behind **Nginx reverse proxy**. You try accessing the usual login page… nothing special. But then curiosity kicks in.

> 🤔 "What if I just try going directly to `/admin/dashboard.php`?"

You hit enter and — boom — you’re in. No login, no session, nothing.

```bash
https://target-site.com/admin/dashboard.php

## 🔍 Pro Tips

- Always **verify vulnerabilities manually**, don’t blindly trust scanners.
- **Simulate post-exploitation** in a controlled way — prove impact.
- **Use virtual labs** (like Hack The Box, TryHackMe, or your own) to stay sharp.

## ✅ Summary

Penetration testing is a craft — it demands both technical skill and ethical discipline. Following a clear methodology and documenting your work will separate you from the amateurs.

> 🔐 “Hacking isn't about breaking systems; it's about understanding them better than their creators.”
